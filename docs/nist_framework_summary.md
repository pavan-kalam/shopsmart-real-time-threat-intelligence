# NIST Framework Summary

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides a flexible and scalable approach to managing cybersecurity risks. It is designed to help any organizations and sectors to improve their cybersecurity posture.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Core Functions**:
   - **Govern**: Establishes and oversees cybersecurity policies aligned with business objectives and risk management.
   - **Identify**: Understand and manage cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.
   - **Protect**: Put safeguards in place to keep your critical services running smoothly.
   - **Detect**: Develop activities to identify cybersecurity events.
   - **Respond**: Have a plan to act quickly when any cybersecurity incidents detected.
   - **Recover**: Restore services and capabilities after a cybersecurity event.

2. **Implementation Tiers**:
   - Tiers (1 to 4) help organizations assess the maturity of their cybersecurity practices. Tier 1 represents the least mature approach, while Tier 4 indicates a highly adaptive and continuously improving cybersecurity posture.

3. **Profiles**:
   - Organizations can create *Current* and *Target* profiles to align cybersecurity practices with business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources.

4. **Governance**:
   - Cybersecurity isn’t just an IT problem—it’s a business problem. CSF 2.0 reminds us to involve leadership to integrate cybersecurity into overall business strategy.

## NIST SP 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF)
The NIST SP 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF) provides a structured process for integrating security and risk management into the system development lifecycle.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **RMF Steps**:
   - **Prepare**: Establish context and readiness for managing security and privacy risks. 
   - **Categorize**: Categorize the system and information based on impact levels.
   - **Select**: Choose the right security controls to protect your system based on risk assessment.
   - **Implement**: Implement the selected controls and document how they are deployed.
   - **Assess**: Evaluate the controls to make sure they’re doing their job.
   - **Authorize**: Obtain management approval for system operation based on risk evaluation.
   - **Monitor**: Continuously monitor the system and controls for changes and effectiveness.

2. **Integration with SDLC**:
   - RMF is designed to be integrated into the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), ensuring security is considered at every stage.

3. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - RMF emphasizes the importance of ongoing monitoring to adapt to new threats and vulnerabilities.

4. **Roles and Responsibilities**:
   - RMF clearly defines roles such as *System Owner* (who is incharge of the system), *Authorizing Official* (who gives final approval), and *Security Control Assessor* to ensure accountability.
