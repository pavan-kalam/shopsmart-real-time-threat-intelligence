# Security Audit Report
*Date*: April 01, 2025  
*System*: Real-Time Threat Intelligence (Flask API)  
*Tools*: Nmap, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite  

## Overview
This audit assesses the security of the Flask-based threat intelligence system running on `http://0.0.0.0:5002`. The system was tested for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weak points.

## Findings

### 1. Nmap Scan
- **Port Exposure**:
  - **Details**: Port 5002 is open, running Werkzeug/2.3.7 (Python 3.11.5).

  - **Risk**: Low; expected for a web server, but ensure only intended ports are exposed in production.
  - **Recommendation**: Use a firewall (e.g., `ufw`) to restrict access to 5002 in production.

### 2. OWASP ZAP Scan
- **CORS Misconfiguration**:
  - **Details**: CORS allows `http://localhost:3000` only, but no validation for other origins or methods.
  - **Risk**: Medium; could allow unauthorized cross-origin requests if misconfigured further.
  - **Recommendation**: Use a stricter CORS policy (e.g., `CORS(app, resources={r"/api/*": {"origins": ["http://localhost:3000"], "methods": ["GET", "POST"]}})`) and disable in production unless needed.
- **Debug Mode Enabled**:
  - **Details**: `app.run(debug=True)` exposes stack traces on errors.
  - **Risk**: High; attackers can gain system details.
  - **Recommendation**: Disable debug mode in production (`debug=False`).
- **No Rate Limiting**:
  - **Details**: `/api/login` accepts unlimited requests.
  - **Risk**: Medium; susceptible to brute-force attacks.
  - **Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting (e.g., Flask-Limiter).

### 3. Burp Suite Testing
- **Potential SQL Injection**:
  - **Details**: Inputs to `/api/register` and `/api/login` are escaped by Flask-SQLAlchemy, but custom queries (if any) need validation.
  - **Risk**: Low; mitigated by ORM, but untested raw SQL could be vulnerable.
  - **Recommendation**: Avoid raw SQL; use parameterized queries if needed.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**:
  - **Details**: `/api/user/<int:user_id>` lacks authorization checks.
  - **Risk**: High; any user can access othersâ€™ data by guessing IDs.
  - **Recommendation**: Add user authentication and ownership checks (e.g., `if user.id != current_user.id: return 403`).

## Recommendations
1. **Network Security**: Restrict port 5002 access with a firewall.
2. **Web Security**: Disable debug mode, enforce strict CORS, and add rate limiting.
3. **Application Security**: Implement authentication/authorization for all endpoints, especially `/api/user/<int:user_id>`.

## Conclusion
The system is functional but has moderate to high-risk vulnerabilities in its current state. Addressing these issues will enhance security for production deployment.
